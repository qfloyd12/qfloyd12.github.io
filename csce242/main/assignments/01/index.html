        <h1>Info about National Football Leage</h1>
        
        <p>The National Football League (NFL) is the largest professional American football league, consisting of 32 teams across the United States of America. The league's teams are divided into two conferences: the American Football Conference (AFC) and the National Football Conference (NFC). These two conferences have four divisions named South, West, East, and North, each consisting of 16 teams. During the season, they play 18 games to determine who advances to the playoffs. Whichever team wins their playoff match is crowned the winner of their respective conference. The best teams from each conference then play in the Super Bowl to determine the overall champion.</p>

        <h2>Basic Rules of Football</h2>
        <p>Football is a sport played by 11 players on a rectangular field that is typically 100 yards long, with a goal at each end. They play with an oval-like inflated ball. The object of the game is for one team to outscore the other. Both teams switch between offense and defense. The goal for the offense is to score a touchdown, while the defense tries to stop the offense from scoring. The ways to score include a touchdown, an extra point conversion, a two-point conversion, a field goal, or a safety.</p>
